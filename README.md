# Staffing Changes Statement (25/11/23)
Hey team,

On the **20th of November** I posted a serverwide announcement which you can read on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/917958310664241192/925955695642284072/1176009909641424916) or [archived here](./images/public-announcement.jpg).

Moments after that, I posted a note in `#staff-chat` that you can read in full here: [Staff Announcement](./images/staff-announcement.jpg)

On the **23rd of November**, I was asked why two admins had been demoted. If you read the image above, you can see my comment on why. Per the post, this created a level playing field for open discussion for the development of a staff code of conduct without the possibility of any server changes occurring before decisions by everyone were finalised. If you'd like to read the current draft that folks had been asked to comment on, you can see that here: [NZFriends Mod Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NZFriends/code-of-conduct).

No staff were asked to leave at any time and made their own decisions.
